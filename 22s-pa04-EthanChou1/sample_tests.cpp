 * This file contains some simple tests.

 * DO NOT add the #define CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER to this file.
 * It is already in catch_setup.cpp
 *
 * Note that you can have more than one cpp file with tests in them.
 * For example, you could have a test file for your DSString and a
 * separate one for your DSVector.
